# CSP Cells
CSP Cells is an experimental library for Communicating Sequential Processes in JavaScript

## File Structure
`./src` contains a series of index.js files which represent different experiments with the library files. The bulk of the code for the library is in chan.js.

## Purpose
I wanted to experiment with a CSP-based JavaScript UI framework, using new and experimental JavaScript features such as
 generators, async/await, iterators, and others. This is the result of those experiments.
